# dot

Provides 3 services for me:
 - A place to store my configuration files (dot files).
 - A quick setup of my basic stuff for when I want to.
 - A tiny site to view messages from my raspberry pi(s).

# (un)install

Use one of the `./dot-install-XXX.sh` scripts to install stuff with.
If I ever feel like it I will make an uninstall script.
